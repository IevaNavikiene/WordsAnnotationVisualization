# WordsAnnotationVisualization

The goal of this repository is to make the appealing interface for words clustering into categories
according to the given list. </br>
Categories should appear as large bubbles with category name when zoomed out.
When zoom in the category name should change into all words.</br>
There should be a possibility to move a word from one cluster to another and export categories with new list afterward.</br>

## Getting started


## Used examples
1) https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7607535

## Next steps
1. Implement nodes clustering. Did not found the right design but it would be like in one of these tutorials:
a) https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063530
b) 
2. Implement nodes editing by draging ( this my help https://bl.ocks.org/adamfeuer/042bfa0dde0059e2b288 find demo here http://bl.ocks.org/adamfeuer/raw/042bfa0dde0059e2b288/)
3. If words clustering would be used as phrases clustering the n tooltip may bee used like here https://github.com/vlandham/bubble_chart_v4 and their demo here http://vallandingham.me/bubble_chart_v4/
